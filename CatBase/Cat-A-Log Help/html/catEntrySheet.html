      The computer will may some guesses of what you mean while you are typing. These will appear after the typing caret, outlined in yellow. If they are what you want, press the right arrow key (not tab) to accept them. If they are not, just ignore them and keep typing. There is no need to press delete.
      <br>
      
      Sometimes you can override whatever the computer suggests, and type whatever you want. However, there are certain fields in which you MUST stick to one of the computer's choices - like breed of the cat, which must be a recognized QFA breed.
      <br>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <ul>
        
        <li>The title is an abbreviation of the cats titles. Choose between no title, Ch, GC, DGC, BDGC, SDGC, GDGC, PDGC, ACF AoE, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Ruby, Diamond or type in any title. Titles can be strung together in a chain, e.g. 'ACF AoE Silver DGC'
        </li><br>
        
        <li>Enter the cat's prefix and name into the name field. Do not bother using caps, as the program will capitalise the name itself.
        </li><br>
        
        <li>The breed can be any ACF recognized breed. You can either choose from a drop list, or type the breed in. As you type, a guess of which breed you mean will appear based on what you have typed so far. You cannot enter any breed except a recognized one.
        </li><br>
        
        <li>The colour can be chosen from a drop list or typed in. As you type, a guess of which colour you mean will appear based on what you have typed so far. If you cannot find the colour of the cat you are entering, you can check in the colours database.
        </li><br>
        
        <li>The sex of the entry can be chosen from a drop list or typed in. Choose between male, female, neuter and spey.
        </li><br>
        
        <li>The registration number of the entry is typed into this field. If a cat with that registration number is already in the database, the computer will load all of it's details into the entry sheet for you.
        </li><br>
        
        <li>The class of the cat can be chosen from a drop list or typed in. Choose between kitten, open, gold, or platinum (and above). The age class of the kitten will be automatically worked out by the computer, so you do not have to worry about that.
        </li><br>
        
        <li>The Sire, Dam, Breeder, and Exhibitor of the cat are typed into the respective fields. The computer makes a few guesses about these, but you can overwrite these if you wish.
        </li><br>
        
        <li>Tick/untick each of the check boxes for the rings that the cat is entered into. The computer assumes the cat is entered into each ring, so originally ticks each check box. To toggle these check boxes from the keyboard, press cmd 1, 2, 3, or 4.
        </li><br>
        
        <li>Select the correct radio button for the cage size of the entry. It defaults to a (standard) small cage. However, you can select large, other or hire instead.
          <ul>
            <li>Click small (or type cmd S) if they are supplying a (standard) small cage.
            </li>
            <li>Click large (or type cmd L) if they are supplying a (standard) large cage.
            </li>
            <li>Click other (or type cmd O) if they are supplying a non-standard size cage. Type the size of this cage (in mm) in the text box next to the button, then press tab.
            </li>
            <li>Click hire (or type cmd H) if they are hiring a QFA cage.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br>The computer will later generate a report giving the expected floorspace each ring will occupy, and a list of which people will be hiring cages.
        </li><br>
        
        <li>Tick the will-work check box (or type cmd W) if the exhibitor has offered to help at the show. The report will then give a listing of all the people willing to work at the show.
        </li><br>
        
        <li>Press 'OK' (or type enter) for the computer to accept your changes. Press 'Cancel' (or type esc) to discard them.
        </li>
        
      </ul>
