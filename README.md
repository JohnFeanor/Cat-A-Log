# Cat-A-Log
## An application to help with Cat Shows
Show secretaries can input the information needed for each cat, pedigree or domestic, entered into a cat show.
To help with entry of a cat into multiple shows, a database is maintained of each cat entered into the show. The name and registration of that cat must be unique. If a cat in the databae is entered into a show, the details of that cat are automatically given. These details (excepting the name and registration) can be overwritten by the show secrtetary and this new data will be stored into the database.
There are several different methods that cats will be organised into a show, depending on the council or club running the show. The show secretary needs to determine from a pop-down menu which of these methods will be used to sort the show catalogue.
Once all cats are entered, the show secretary can save the files needed to organise the show. These are an rtf catalogue of the cat in the order they will be appearing, as well as several modified catalogues containing no identifying information on the cat for each of the judges at the show. There is also an xml file with several spreadsheets giving lists of cats entered and their owners for use in generating challenge certificates, entry slips and working out an appropriate show layout.

The application is written in Swift 5 and use Core Data. Please be gentle - it is my first attempt.
